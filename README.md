# Linear-Regression-Assumptions-Very Important Interview Question.



Q.What are all the assumptions of Linear Regression

1.There should be a **Linear Relationship** between input and output. Positive or Negative linear Relationship not an issue

2.**Multicolinearity** should not exits.There should not be any relationship between our input columns.all should be independent.

Multicollinearity

Multicollinearity refers to the presence of high correlation between independent variables in a regression model, which can cause issues such as unstable coefficient estimates and difficulty in interpreting the effects of individual predictors.

3.Normality of residuals (**Distribution of residuals/errors should be normal**)
4.Homoscadascity: The plot of errors should be homogenous.
**Homoscedasticity**

Homoscedasticity means that the "spread" or "scatter" of data points around the regression line stays roughly the same across all values of the independent variable. In other words, it suggests that the variability in the outcomes is consistent, regardless of the predictor's values.

5.**No autocorrelation** between residuals/errors.
